    <summary>Simple yet versatile library for generating graphs in the DOT language.</summary>
    
    <description>A simple solution for generating graphs in the DOT language. The output is a textual script that may be visualized or converted to an image, using Graphviz software. There are also handy visualization tools like Graphviz Preview for Visual Studio Code, or online tools like viz-js.com or www.webgraphviz.com, where you paste a script to view its visualization.</description>
    
    <releaseNotes>-Properties on attribute collections of graph elements have been grouped to provide better clarity of the contexts they refer to. For instance, the Peripheries, Sides, Skew, Distortion, Rotation, and Regular properties of a node's attribute collection are accessible now by an upper-level property named Geometry.

- Graph attributes applicable globally to clusters have been moved to the Clusters collection of the root graph.

- The Style of elements is more intuitive to specify now.

- Added a GetMetadataDictionary() method on attribute collections to provide a mapping between DOT attribute keys and the properties they are exposed by.

- Added a static DotAttributeValueAttribute.GetValueMapping() method to provide a mapping between DOT attribute values and the values they are exposed by enumeration types.

- Added a static DotAttributeKeys class for providing attribute key consts and metadata (DotAttributeKeys.MetadataDictionary). The metadata includes information what element a given attribute can be applied to, and also what layout engine and output format supports it according to the documentation.

- Added support for attributes: landscape, orientation (attribute specifications are available at http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).

- Refactoring.
