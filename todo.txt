Road map:
1. Gradually add support for all available attributes (page, pack, packmode).
2. Verify the correctness of XML documentations.

Other:
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Some attributes are settable only on specified types of elements, but it turns out that the documentation is not always right, and other elements support those attributes too.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
2. Attribute types, even if not exposed as properties.
