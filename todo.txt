Road map:
1. Gradually add support for all available attributes (imagepath, imagepos, inputscale, shapefile, truecolor, pad, pack, packmode).
2. Verify the correctness of XML documentations.

Other (always valid): 
1. Check if methods are coherently marked as virtual.
2. Check if interfaces should be extracted for any classes.
3. Check if properties should or shouldn't have setters.
4. Some attributes are settable only on specified types of elements, but it turns out that the documentation is not always right, and other elements support those attributes too.

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#polygon.
2. Text justification markers support (\l, \r) and others like \N, \E etc.
4. Attribute types, even if not exposed as properties.
