To do:
1. Gradually add support for all available attributes.
2. Add info to all property comments that determines what engine/format a given property is supported by, and also their default values.
3. Verify the correctness of XML documentations.
4. Check if methods and properties are coherently marked as virtual (or remove the virtual specifier from everywhere where not useful internally?).

Nice-to-haves:
1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html.
2. Add attribute type implementations, even if not exposed as properties.
