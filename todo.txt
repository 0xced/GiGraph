To do:

1. Fix comments! They are not inherited from interfaces implicitly.
2. Add CopyFrom methods to property groups (to be able to copy props from another instance).
3. Add info to all property comments that determines what engine/format a given property is supported by, and also their default values.

4. Gradually add support for all available attributes.
5. Verify the correctness of XML documentations.
6. Check if methods and properties are coherently marked as virtual (or remove the virtual specifier from everywhere where not useful internally?).


Nice-to-haves:

1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html.
2. Add attribute type implementations, even if not exposed as properties.
