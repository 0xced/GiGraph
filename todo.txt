To do:

1. Gradually add support for all available attributes.
2. Verify the correctness of XML documentations (esp. embedded properties like hyperlink and font in different contexts where they are used).
3. Check if methods and properties are coherently marked as virtual (or remove the virtual specifier from everywhere where not useful internally?).


Nice-to-haves:

1. Implement predefined HTML nodes: https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html.
2. Add attribute type implementations, even if not exposed as properties.
